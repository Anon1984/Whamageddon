# Whamageddon
Whamageddon is a game played during the 24 days before Christmas in which players try to go from 1 December to the end of Christmas Eve (24 December) without hearing the song "Last Christmas" by British pop duo Wham!. Based on the Little Drummer Boy Challenge from the mid-1990s if the player hears the song between those days, they are out of the game and have to post "#Whamageddon" on social media to indicate that they have lost. The exceptions to this game are that the player can only listen to remixes and cover versions of the song. 
It is not against the rules to play or send the song to others, but players are not encouraged to do so. 
Whamageddon is described as a survival game
